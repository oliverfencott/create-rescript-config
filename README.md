# Create ReScript config

A simple CLI utility to generate the required files to get you up and running with [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/).

Simply type

```bash
yarn create rescript-config

# or

npx create-rescript-config
```

And follow the instructions. Once complete, you'll have a new `bsconfig.json` file and `clean`/`build`/`watch` npm scripts in your `package.json`.
